----------
NEXT RELEASE:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
2) Sort out error/warnings in src/*.c.  Should probably use err_dlg, or warn_dlg unless GTK is not running, then report in text mode.
----------

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).
2) Proxy server option?

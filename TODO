----------
NEXT RELEASE:
1) test all filters thoroughly with valgrind
2) Final release: Update webpage, build mailtc, build example plugin, update ebuild

----------
ONE AFTER:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
2) Remove UIDL_LEN for imapfunc and make dynamic instead
3) Sort out error/warnings in src/*.c.  Should probably use err_dlg, or warn_dlg unless GTK is not running, then report in text mode.
4) Compile/test on win32
    a) Compile rest of plugins and test
    b) Use Nullsoft scriptable installer as an installer and test.
    c) Make sure GtkStatusIcon stuff is correct.
5) autogen.sh script svn checkouts?
----------

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).
2) Proxy server option?
3) Extend the stuff that can be used for the mail command ($ stuff)
4) Non-blocking sockets?

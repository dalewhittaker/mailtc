NEXT RELEASE:

1) Compile/test on win32
    a) Get mingw working and build absolute minimal mailtc, test.
    b) Get SSL working and test.
    c) Use Nullsoft scriptable installer as an installer and test.

2) Test latest fixes (with valgrind):
    a) make sure if the panel dies, and is then brought back, mailtc get's brought back too.
    b) test with icon test script on openbox
        i) docklet test 1
        ii) docklet test 2
    c) test with icon test script on fluxbox
        i) docklet test 1
        ii) docklet test 2
    d) do final make 2>op to see if there are any issues.

4) Test with valgrind:
    valgrind needs to be run as follows:

    G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --leak-check=full --error-limit=no

    NOTE: currently g_module_open() dlopen() are reporting errors, need to investigate this
    (e.g write small app that calls dlopen to check whether problem is specific to mailtc)

    a) everything plugin related
    b) the message list/header adding
    c) config file reading
    d) pop stuff
    e) filter stuff
    f) localisation stuff
    g) connection error stuff
    h) run command on new mail stuff
    i) IMAP stuff.  NOTE mark as read stuff needs full heavy testing.
    j) With/without message list disabled
    k) All stuff relating to the docklet and tooltip
    l) config dialog ref counting: we really need to check that everything is being alloc'ed/free'd ok.
    m) docklet stuff; see docklet1 and docklet2 test scripts

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Split the config dialog stuff to a separate app (mailtc-config), and keep the rest as mailtc.
2) Improve plugin architecture so that it is possible to have plugin specific options in config dialog. This would likely mean reworking all the filter stuff.
3) sumdlg

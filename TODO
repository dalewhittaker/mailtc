----------
NEXT RELEASE:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
2) Sort out error/warnings in src/*.c.  Should probably use err_dlg, or warn_dlg unless GTK is not running, then report in text mode.
    i) remove err_exit
    ii) remove err_noexit
    iii) make sure all messages have "\n" at the end.  Then add code to use strchomp if reporting with gtk.  Reporting with glib etc should always have "\n".
----------

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).
2) Proxy server option?

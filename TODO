NEXT RELEASE:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there

        i) should ref count when initially started
        ii) when combo box is changed and notebook_tab removed, plugin widget should not be destroyed
                instead, all values should be cleared and re-read if necessary.
        iv) when unload is called, drop the reference count and destroy the widget.
    b) use dummy as reference and move filters over

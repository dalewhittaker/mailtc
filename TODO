----------
NEXT RELEASE:
1) final cleanup/testing of xml files/filters (with valgrind)
    a) test all xml file stuff with valgrind
    b) test all filters thoroughly with valgrind
    c) test mailtc itself works, with valgrind
    d) test UIDL_LEN thing for popfunc
2) sort all the localisation strings, and all them silly warnings (test each warning with valgrind after changing)
3) Sort out error/warnings in src/*.c.  Should probably use err_dlg, or warn_dlg unless GTK is not running, then report in text mode.
----------

----------
ONE AFTER:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
2) Compile/test on win32
    a) Compile rest of plugins and test
    b) Use Nullsoft scriptable installer as an installer and test.
    c) Make sure GtkStatusIcon stuff is correct.
3) Remove UIDL_LEN for imapfunc and make dynamic instead
----------

Stuff to test with valgrind:
    valgrind needs to be run as follows:

    G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --leak-check=full --error-limit=no

    NOTE: currently g_module_open() dlopen() are reporting errors, need to investigate this
    (e.g write small app that calls dlopen to check whether problem is specific to mailtc)

    a) everything plugin related
    b) the message list/header adding
    c) config file reading/writing
    d) pop stuff
    e) filter stuff
    f) localisation stuff
    g) connection error stuff
    h) run command on new mail stuff
    i) IMAP stuff.  NOTE mark as read stuff needs full heavy testing.
    j) With/without message list disabled
    k) All stuff relating to the docklet and tooltip
    l) config dialog ref counting: we really need to check that everything is being alloc'ed/free'd ok.
    m) docklet stuff; see docklet1 and docklet2 test scripts

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).
2) Proxy server option?
3) Extend the stuff that can be used for the mail command ($ stuff)
4) Non-blocking sockets?

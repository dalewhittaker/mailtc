NEXT RELEASE:

1) new stuff
    a) Implement new xml config
        i) sort out config.multiple and the config icon stuff
        ii) sort out the account password stuff
        iii) sort out if MINIMAL config option is selected.
        iv) check for duplicates
        v) pass default values is not found in config, otherwise fail
        vi) any additional cleanup (see TODO's in filefunc.c)
        vi) make sure that uidlfiles are all in correct order compared to account list
        vii) re-write filter stuff to go with the xml config
            a) Ben wants To: and Cc: fields added to filter stuff
        viii) get libmxl to compile with autoconf/automake
        ix) testing, including if certain config/account info is not found that needs to be there.

2) Compile/test on win32
    a) After xml stuff is done, get it all to compile on win32
    b) Test it all works, port any stuff back if needed
    c) Use Nullsoft scriptable installer as an installer and test.

2) Test with valgrind:
    valgrind needs to be run as follows:

    G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --leak-check=full --error-limit=no

    NOTE: currently g_module_open() dlopen() are reporting errors, need to investigate this
    (e.g write small app that calls dlopen to check whether problem is specific to mailtc)

    a) everything plugin related
    b) the message list/header adding
    c) config file reading
    d) pop stuff
    e) filter stuff
    f) localisation stuff
    g) connection error stuff
    h) run command on new mail stuff
    i) IMAP stuff.  NOTE mark as read stuff needs full heavy testing.
    j) With/without message list disabled
    k) All stuff relating to the docklet and tooltip
    l) config dialog ref counting: we really need to check that everything is being alloc'ed/free'd ok.
    m) docklet stuff; see docklet1 and docklet2 test scripts

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Improve plugin architecture so that it is possible to have plugin specific options in config dialog. This would likely mean reworking all the filter stuff.
2) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).

***TO ADD NEW LANG***
use msginit -l <lang> in po dir to create po file
translate the po file
add the lang to ALL_LINGUAS in configure.ac
aclocal;autoconf;automake
./configure;make etc

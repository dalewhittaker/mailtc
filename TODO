MAILTC NG (PART 1)!!!!!

1) Major testing

Things to test:

a) test work on docklet.c (make sure no mem leaks), also docklet_clicked() for one POP and one IMAP protocol
b) final simple test; test with valgrind from start to finish what a new user would do (all possibilities)



1.0.x (PART 2)

1) Make localisable with gettext
2) Allow to enable debug at compile time (e.g ./configure --enable-debug)
3) Make modular (with network plugins)

NEXT RELEASE:

1) new stuff
    a) fix problem with calling mtc_dir at start of main, this cannot be done as err_exit will not work by that point
    b) Implement new xml config
        i) config file
        ii) account* files
        iii) filter* files

    c) Revamped config (see also wish list task 1).
    d) Ben wants To: field added to filter stuff

2) Compile/test on win32
    a) Get mingw working and build absolute minimal mailtc, test.
    b) Get SSL working and test.
    c) Use Nullsoft scriptable installer as an installer and test.

2) Test with valgrind:
    valgrind needs to be run as follows:

    G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --leak-check=full --error-limit=no

    NOTE: currently g_module_open() dlopen() are reporting errors, need to investigate this
    (e.g write small app that calls dlopen to check whether problem is specific to mailtc)

    a) everything plugin related
    b) the message list/header adding
    c) config file reading
    d) pop stuff
    e) filter stuff
    f) localisation stuff
    g) connection error stuff
    h) run command on new mail stuff
    i) IMAP stuff.  NOTE mark as read stuff needs full heavy testing.
    j) With/without message list disabled
    k) All stuff relating to the docklet and tooltip
    l) config dialog ref counting: we really need to check that everything is being alloc'ed/free'd ok.
    m) docklet stuff; see docklet1 and docklet2 test scripts

WISH LIST TASKS:
1) Improve plugin architecture so that it is possible to have plugin specific options in config dialog. This would likely mean reworking all the filter stuff.
2) Threading, allowing reading (click) when checking new mail (big job).

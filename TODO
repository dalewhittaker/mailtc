NEXT RELEASE:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
    a) get checkbox properly working
    a) use dummy as reference and move filters over
        i) put_config/get checkbox properly working
        ii) probably going to have to add a free_config routine. bummer.
        iv) get above working for one plugin, then working for all
    b) make sure everything works with MTC_NOTMINIMAL not defined (i.e minimal build)
    c) remove the strings.h file from the filter.c file and check all plg_err() lines
    d) test lots with valgrind
    e) get plugins working nicely together, e.g the dialogs
    f) should the tab be removed from the notebook or simply hidden/shown?

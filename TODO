NEXT RELEASE
1) Add the French translation (from Val) package the bugger up, do the usual stuff

ONE AFTER
1) Make modular (with network plugins)
2) Once modular, tidy up core/plugins as follows:
	a) core should use mainly (if not all) glib/gtk functions rather than standard ANSI/POSIX functions
	   this is desirable mainly as it is much tidyer, and probably less error prone.
	b) plugin code should use ONLY ANSI/POSIX. Reason for this is that they are not GUI based, and this
	   way other apps can use (e.g if i decide i don't like the GTK core or create a different core).

there you go...

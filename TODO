This release
- valgrind/testing etc


Next release
- Automated testing.
- IMAP.
- Config file encryption.
- Use GResource for icon resource?
- Use GSettings once it allows to do lists
- GNotification API, this way it should work with wayland.
- Would be nice to have restart option
    e.g -c allows configuration while running.
    then -r restarts etc.

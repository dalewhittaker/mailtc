NEXT RELEASE:
1) Rework plugin API so that the filters can be moved there
    a) use dummy as reference and move filters over
        ii) get above working for one plugin, then working for all
    b) make sure everything works with MTC_NOTMINIMAL not defined (i.e minimal build)
    c) check all plg_err() lines, some will need to be dialogs, some plg_err with correct CR
    d) test lots with valgrind
    e) get plugins working nicely together, e.g the dialogs

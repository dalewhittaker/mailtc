Added greater functionality to the app launching string.  It is now possible
to use the character '$' anywhere in the string, and this will be converted to
the id of the current account that has been clicked (or -1 for multiple
accounts).  This way it is now possible to launch a different application
depending on the account that is clicked.

1.0.0:
Improved the error reporting routines so that they also report the current
time. Happy 1.0.0 mailtc!!!

1.0.1:
Mailtc can now be internationalised with gettext.

1.0.2:
Moved header files to separate include directory.

does not use these).

1.0.6:
Config dialog now uses the network plugins completely, rather than hard coded
protocols.

1.0.7:
Converted much to glib (although still some to be done).

1.0.8:
Finished conversion to glib, added a plugin information button to the config
dialog.

1.0.9:
Finally got that god damn network plugin code to work :)

1.1.0:
Moved the account list over to a GSList, and removed unneeded functions.

1.1.1:
Heaps of tidying up to exit gracefully when something bad happens.
The config dialog now only allows filters if MTC_ENABLE_FILTERS is defined in
the plugin flags.

1.1.2:
Docklet click stuff moved totally to plugins, mailtc is now fully independent
of network code.
Lots more tidying up, full functionality before next release almost there.

1.1.3:
Added a plugin compatibility check, cleaned up all the strings.

1.1.4:
Plugins are now installed with autotools.

1.1.5:
Fixed bug with writing plugins, and bug with -v option.

1.1.6:
All the libgsasl stuff removed and CRAM-MD5 code ported to openssl, mailtc now no longer requires libgsasl.

1.1.7:
Passwords are no longer displayed in network debug mode.

1.1.8:
Added some free()'s where they were missing, and removed some free()'s where
they shouldn't have been.

1.1.9:
Fixed problem reported on sourceforge about receiving capability string

1.2.0:
Updated the message handling so that the return value from the plugin is used as the number of new messages.
This value MUST be returned from the plugin in order for mailtc to correctly report.
Also wrote an example plugin that can be used as a template for anyone who wishes to write their own plugin.
Added load/unload routines to all plugins.

1.2.1:
Changed a lot of POSIX functions to use the glib equivalents to make more
portable.  The pid routines are now also only used if POSIX routines are
defined.

1.2.2:
Changed the non portable app launching code bit to make it portable.

1.2.3:
Tidyed up the ugly config file reading/writing code.

1.2.4:
Totally cleaned and rewrote the POP3 code, and ported it to use glib.

1.2.5:
Added new method for getting mail information, such as mail headers, and
ported mail filtering to use it.  This means that all sorts of information is
now held in the mail list.

1.2.6:
Added a timeout for connect() so that it doesn't wait forever.

1.2.7:
New improved icons (thanks goes to gnome-icons as i based they are based on
them).
Ported the localisation routines to glib.

1.2.8:
Massive tidying of the IMAP code (now ~300 less lines with more
functionality), and general tidying of all other code.
Made uid of each message in list dynamically allocated rather than static,
to save space in the case of large message lists.

1.2.9:
Added option to configure the frequency of connection error reporting.
General tidying of the config dialog.

1.3.0:
Added option to run a user defined command when a new mail arrives.
Tidied up function/struct/enum names.

Now stores all POP mails as read upon first ever time mailtc is executed.
Added --disable-pop and --disable-imap compile options for extra
configurability.
Disabled the summary dialog for now as it is broken.
Fixed number of issues with emails not conforming to the spec.

1.3.2:
Added --disable-msglist.  This removes the message list for POP, taking away a
number of features, but makes the build minimal.
Added table routines to make the dialog widgets easier to add, and less bug
prone.

1.3.3:
Vastly improved the docklet loading code.  Previously this created/destroyed
the image and trayicon widgets everytime the mail status changed.  Now it
simply creates everyting once, and adds/removes everything when needed.  This
results in it being faster, and the code being more simplistic to read, and
less bug prone.
Changed --disable-msglist to --enable-minimal.  This can be used to build a
bare bones mailtc.  Modified the existing code so that small icon option is
now not available with --enable-minimal.

1.3.4:
Added GtkStatusIcon support.  This is not used by default due to limitations,
but can be switched on.  GtkStatusIcon will allow mailtc to be compiled on
win32 in the future.

1.3.5:
Updated the network routines to also use equivalent winsock routines for win32
build.
Fix bug with icon size for accounts.
Fix ref count issue.
Fix icon issue on fluxbox.
Add compatibility macros for GTK 2.4.
Fix issue with default icon not being created with clean install.
Fix issues with va_lists on some platforms.
Fix pid code on clean install.
Add code to detect if panel dies, and reload the icon.

1.3.6:
Much needed cleanup of header files.
Password is now base64 encoded for future xml config.
Read/write password from account files instead of separate password files.
